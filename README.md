Due to the inconsistencies with cooling in the refrigeration system, developing a device to monitor temperatures in an RV refrigerator and freezer combination unit.  Will display the current temperature of each unit, along with the minimum, maximum, average, and the ability to alert when a threshold has been breached.

Currently utilizing the following devices:
- Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266
